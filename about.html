			<p>I realized I loved creating websites during college while obtaining my B.A. in Environmental Studies, and committed to learning the fundamentals of web design & development in 2020. With a background in environmental studies and sustainable development, I look for projects that have a positive social or environmental mission.</p>

			<p>I use HTML and CSS, website building platforms, and CMS's including Drupal to create aesthetically-pleasing, accessible, and engaging <a href="projects.html">websites</a>. I have worked as a web producer and project coordinator for multiple web launches in my current role, and have built out websites for clients' needs on an individual basis. I implement SEO and web accessibility best practices in addition to exceeding clients' expectations.</p>
