				<h3>ANR Alliance Website | Squarespace</h3><br>

				<h4>Contributions:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Implementing styleguide</li>
					<li>Custom CSS</li>
					<li>QA</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="project-description">I did this project in my position as a Junior Web Producer in conjunction with the Restoration Team and WRI Brasil team. The website is a simple brochureware website that conveys the basics about assisted natural regeneration in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. The site uses colors and fonts inspired by a graphic from the Brasil team, which was put into a palette by the design team. I implemented these colors in a way that will ensure it is visually accessible to users. For this project, I helped with photo selection and placement, implemented site colors, held regular check-in meetings with the team, and incorporated custom CSS to the website to customize button styling, disable clicking categories and tags in the blog section, and set the active styling for the navigation.</p>

				<h4>Contributions:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Wireframing</li>

					<li>Photo research</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="project-description">I did this project as a Digital Content Intern with the Cities4Forests team at WRI. I created wireframes following a project brief in June 2021, and then wrote HTML and CSS to create an example of the grid to use on the site. The front-end developer on the team implemented the mockup onto live. I added each piece of content for the project, including doing photo research and tracking project materials for 57 cities total. I collaborated with the team to align on a structure for each of the individual city pages, and implemented these accordingly with the materials as they came in from each city official. The microsite launched in September 2021.</p>

				<p class="project-description">I did this project as a Digital Content Intern with the Restoration team at WRI. The purpose of the site was to have people apply to receive funding for 100 restoration projects in Africa. I built the site over the course of 2 weeks. I implemented the site content, colors, and custom CSS including a way to add styling for language switching on the site. After the applications were closed and champions were selected, I’ve worked with the team to add the champion bios to the site, and am currently working with them on a solution to add a total of 100 champion bios with a filtering option. The site received 47,000 unique visits in 2021 during request for proposal with a 19,000 button clicks (47% conversion rate), and an additional 11,000 unique visits in 2022 so far.</p>

				<p class="project-description">This was the first website project I created on Squarespace for a client. I built and published the site in March 2021. The site was for Exceedingly Good Song Night, a community-based singing event based in New York, NY. The purpose of the site was to increase interest and sign-ups for a singing event which went virtual during the pandemic, and has continued to be virtual since then. I created the color palette from graphic designs and images that were designed for the project. I advised on site structure, content structure on the pages, and color palette and font selection.</p>

				<p class="project-description">I did this project independently, using skills that I learned through Scrimba. This is a very simple application to count clicks and save the number of clicks you have done so far. I chose the colors and styling for this project, and determined the JavaScript for the functionality. I am currently strengthening my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the Front-End Developer track at Scrimba. This very simple tool shows my progress towards implementing JavaScript. I also used GitHub to host this website. I am continuing to increase my knowledge of JavaScript and more advanced HTML and CSS. Another project I worked on is a Blackjack game, and I am currently working on a Chrome Extension.</p>

				</ul>
				<p class="project-description">I completed this project at UMGC in the course CMST386 - Principles of Web Design and Technology II in December 2021. I built this site from scratch using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. I determined the site structure and created wireframes, selected a color palette and fonts, selected photos, and wrote content for each page of the site, including 4 blog posts on different travel-related topics. I also included many meta items in the header of each webpage, including the meta description, author, keywords, and robots. This was a good project to build a template from scratch and implement content to fit within the structure of the site. It also gave me ideas for what kind of content I’d like to write if I have a website or blog of my own.</p>

				<p class="project-description">I completed this project at UMGC in the course CMST388 - Fundamentals of JavaScript in March 2022. In this project, I selected photos to implement into a gallery using HTML and CSS, and was tasked with adding interactivity to the gallery using JavaScript. I made it so that the “active” image had a gray border and caption underneath when hovering, that stays after you click on the image. Additionally, the source for the main image changes to the source of the image that you clicked. Finally, I added the Copyright info by altering the DOM using JavaScript to gain practice with this concept.</p>
